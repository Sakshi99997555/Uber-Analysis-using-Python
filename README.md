ðŸ’¡Overview

The Uber Ride Analysis project aims to analyze ride data to understand customer 
behavior, identify trends, and extract actionable insights. This involves extensive 
data preprocessing, feature extraction, and creating visualizations that narrate the
story hidden within the data.

ðŸ’¡Features and Objectives

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and standardize data formats.

Feature Engineering: Extract features like date, time, day, month, and ride shifts (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night).

Data Visualization: Create plots to represent patterns and trends effectively.


ðŸ’¡Answer Key Business Questions:

What are the most common ride purposes?

How does ride frequency vary across time and days?

What is the distribution of trip distances?


ðŸ’¡Technologies Used

This project is built using Python and the following libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

Numpy: For numerical computations.

Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive visualizations.

Seaborn: For advanced statistical plotting.


ðŸ’¡Data Preprocessing

Handling Missing Values:

Imputed missing entries or removed rows/columns where necessary.

Feature Engineering:

Extracted date, time, day, and month from timestamp columns.

Categorized rides into time slots: Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night.

Data Type Conversion:

Standardized columns to appropriate data types for better processing.

Preparation for Analysis:

Filtered and structured the data to focus on meaningful insights.


ðŸ’¡Visualizations

To convey insights effectively, the following visualizations were created:

Countplot: To examine the frequency of ride purposes.

Lineplot: To analyze ride trends over time.

Barplot: For comparative analysis of ride counts by day, month, and shifts.

Boxplot: To study the variability and range of trip distances.

Distplot: To visualize the distribution of trip distances and identify outliers.


ðŸ’¡Insights and Findings

Ride Purposes:

Business-related rides were the most frequent, followed by customer visits and errands.

Time-Based Patterns:

Weekdays (afternoons and evenings) see higher ride counts, while weekends exhibit lower demand, often for leisure purposes.

Distance Distribution:

The majority of trips are short-distance, under 10 miles, with a few long-distance outliers.

Seasonal Trends:

Ride demand remains consistent throughout the year, with occasional peaks during holidays or special events.
